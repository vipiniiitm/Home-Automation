<p>It is a generic solution for home automation enhanced with machine
learning techniques. It uses a well-known wireless device HC-05 for
communication between devices and allows you to collect data and control

arduino is open source with a GNU General Public License. In market,
there are lots of home automation systems, but they lack the adaptability
and generic way of application in variety of home appliances. Moreover,
home appliance control project is open source; it allows collaboration of
developers for new enhancements to the project.</p>
<p>All the inputs are given by Android phone or smart phone by which the
bluetooth module is connected and arduino is controlled. It use software
named Bluetooth terminal for user interfacing.</p>
<p>The input set can be manipulated by coding but here the standard
number assigned for an action is given (Data and fact on components) :-
